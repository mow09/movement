# MOVEMENT
is about moving objects.

## Mandelturtle

```python
pos = get_orbit_points(n)  # returns n positions on circle
draw_lines(pos, factor) # draws lines with turtle
```


## following is old from inner planet system simulation
## current state
moving turtles

TODO:
- [ ] setup:
    - [ ] screen
    - [ ] datetime - positioning
    - [x] which object is fix? - solar - vusual

- [ ] real data
- stars
- [ ] date time
    - if it ends make it mathematics
        - setdown?
        - return angles for each

- positioning for setup
- get_positioning for setdown
    - angle between each to all_objects
    - length == distance each to all_objects

- [ ] !!! objects
    - are surrounding the sun in fix circles
    - have no impact on each other
    - are not real :-1:
    - are points...

__Installation:__ Libraries come with `Python 3.7`.
